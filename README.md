# 🌐 Abhishek's Portfolio

Hey! I'm Abhishek, and this is the code behind my personal portfolio website — a sleek, simple space where I showcase my work, skills, and a bit about who I am. If you're here to stalk my code (👀), you're welcome — clone it, fork it, remix it.

## 🛠️ Built With

This portfolio is a good old-school front-end project, no frameworks — just raw power:

- **HTML5** – markup structure  
- **CSS3** – styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity  

It's clean, fast, and responsive without any unnecessary bloat.
